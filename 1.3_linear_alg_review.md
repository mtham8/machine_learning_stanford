### Linear Algebra Review

- _Matrix_: Rectangular array of numbers
    - _Dimension of matrix_: number of rows * number of columns
    - _Matrix elements_: entries of matrix
    - A<sub>i</sub><sub>j</sub> = `i, j` entry in the `i`th row, `j`th column

- _Vector_: An n * 1 matrix
    - A vector with 'n' rows is referred to as an 'n'-dimensional vector.
    - y<sub>i</sub> = `i`th element

- Matrices are usually denoted by uppercase names while vectors are lowercase.
- _Scalar_ means that an object is a single value, not a vector or matrix.

Octave example

```matlab
% The ; denotes we are going back to a new row.
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12]

% Initialize a vector
v = [1;2;3]

% Get the dimension of the matrix A where m = rows and n = columns
[m,n] = size(A)

% You could also store it this way
dim_A = size(A)

% Get the dimension of the vector v
dim_v = size(v)

% Now let's index into the 2nd row 3rd column of matrix A
A_23 = A(2,3)
```
