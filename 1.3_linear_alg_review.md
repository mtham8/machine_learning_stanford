### Linear Algebra Review

- _Matrix_: Rectangular array of numbers
    - _Dimension of matrix_: number of rows * number of columns
    - _Matrix elements_: entries of matrix
    - A<sub>i</sub><sub>j</sub> = `i, j` entry in the `i`th row, `j`th column

- _Vector_: An n * 1 matrix
    - A vector with 'n' rows is referred to as an 'n'-dimensional vector.
    - y<sub>i</sub> = `i`th element

- Matrices are usually denoted by uppercase names while vectors are lowercase.
- _Scalar_ means that an object is a single value, not a vector or matrix. (real number)

Octave example

```matlab
% The ; denotes we are going back to a new row.
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12]

% Initialize a vector
v = [1;2;3]

% Get the dimension of the matrix A where m = rows and n = columns
[m,n] = size(A)

% You could also store it this way
dim_A = size(A)

% Get the dimension of the vector v
dim_v = size(v)

% Now let's index into the 2nd row 3rd column of matrix A
A_23 = A(2,3)
```

### Addition and Scalar Multiplication

```matlab
% Initialize matrix A and B
A = [1, 2, 4; 5, 3, 2]
B = [1, 3, 4; 1, 1, 1]

% Initialize constant s
s = 2

% See how element-wise addition works
add_AB = A + B

% See how element-wise subtraction works
sub_AB = A - B

% See how scalar multiplication works
mult_As = A * s

% Divide A by s
div_As = A / s

% What happens if we have a Matrix + scalar?
add_As = A + s
```

### Matrix Vector Multiplication

A (matrix) * x (vector) = y

(m * n) matrix * (n * 1) matrix = m-dimensional vector

(m rows, n columns) * (n-dimensional vector) = m-dimensional vector

- to get y<sub>1</sub>, multiply A's `i`th row with elements of vector x, and add them up
- The result is a vector. The number of *columns* of the matrix must equal the number of *rows*
of the vector.

```matlab
% Initialize matrix A
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6;7, 8, 9]

% Initialize vector v
v = [1; 1; 1]

% Multiply A * v
Av = A * v
```

### Matrix Matrix Multiplication

(m * n matrix) * (n * o matrix) = (m * o matrix)

(m rows, n cols) * (n rows, o cols)

- To multiply two matrices, the number of *columns* of the first matrix must equal the number
of *rows* of the second matrix.


### Matrix Multiplication Properties

The *identity matrix*, when multiplied by any matrix of the same dimensions, results in the
original matrix. It's just like multiplying numbers by 1. The identity matrix simply has 1's on
the diagonal (upper left to lower right diagonal) and 0's elsewhere.

When multiplying the identity matrix after some matrix (A∗I), the square identity matrix's
dimension should match the other matrix's *columns*. When multiplying the identity matrix before
some other matrix (I∗A), the square identity matrix's dimension should match the other matrix's
*rows*.

Matrices are not commutative: `A` ∗ `B` ≠ `B` ∗ `A`

Matrices are associative: (`A` ∗ `B`) ∗ `C` = `A` ∗ (`B` ∗ `C`)

- matrix multiplication is associative

- _Identity Matrix_: Denoted `I` (or I<sub>n x n</sub>)
    - For any matrix, `A`, `A` * `I` = `I` * `A` = `A`

### Inverse and Transpose

- Only square matrices have an inverse.

- The inverse of a matrix A is denoted A<sup>-1</sup>. Multiplying by the inverse results in
the identity matrix.

- Matrices that don't have an inverse are "singular" or "degenerate".

- _Matrix Transpose_
    - Let A be an (m * n) matrix, and let B = A<sup>T</sup>.
    - Then B is an (n * m) matrix, and B<sub>ij</sub> = A<sub>ji</sub>

```matlab
% Initialize matrix A
A = [1,2,0;0,5,6;7,0,9]

% Transpose A
A_trans = A'

% Take the inverse of A
A_inv = inv(A)

% What is A^(-1)*A?
A_invA = inv(A)*A
```
