### Machine Learning

- grew out of work in AI
- new capability for computer

Examples:

- database mining
- large datasets from growth of automation/web
(Eg, web click data, medical records, biology, engineering)
- applications can't program by hand
(Eg, autonomous helicopter, handwriting recognition, most of Natural Language Processing (NLP),
Computer Vision)
- self-customizing programs
(Eg, Amazon, Netflix product recommendations)
- understanding human learning (brain, real AI)

### What is Machine Learning

- Arthur Samuel (1959). Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to
learn without being explicitly programmed

- Tom Mitchell (1998) Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to _learn_ from
experience `E` with respect to some task `T` and some performance measure `P`, if its
performance on `T`, as measured by `P`, improves with experience `E`.

Suppose your email program watches which emails you do or do not mark as spam, and based on that
learns how to better filter spam.
- _Task_ : Classifying emails as spam or not spam
- _Experience_: Watching you label emails as spam or not spam
- _Performance_: The number (or fraction) of emails correctly classified as spam/not spam

Machine Learning algorithms:

- supervised learning
- unsupervised learning
- others: reinforcement learning, recommender systems

### Supervised Learning

_Supervised Learning_: "right answers" given

In supervised learning, we are given a dataset and already know what our current output should
look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

- _Regression_: Predict continuous valued output (price)

In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning
that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function.

- _Classification_: Discrete valued output (0 or 1)

In a classification problem, we are trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other
words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.

_Regression Problem_: You have a large inventory of identical items. You want to predict how many
of these items will sell over the next 3 months. (identical items - row values)

_Classification Problem_: You'd like software to examine individual customer accounts, and for
each account decide if it has been hacked/compromised. (0 (not hacked) or 1 (hacked))

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results
should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect
of the variables.

We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in
the data.

With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.

_Clustering_
- example: Google News, groups stories into cohesive stories
- uses: organize computing cluters, social network analysis, market segmentation, astronomical
data analysis
- given a set of news articles found on the web, group them into set of articles about the same
story
- given a database of customer data, automatically discover market segments and group customers
into different market segments

_Non-clustering_
- The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment
(ie. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds)
