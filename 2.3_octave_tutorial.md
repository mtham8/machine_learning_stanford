### Basic Operations

- `~=` not equal
- `%` to comment
- `&&` AND
- `||` OR

- semicolon supresses output
- `disp(sprintf('2 decimals: %0.2f', a))` print string
    - 0.2 = how many places to print

- matrix (3 * 2)
    - `A = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6]`

- vector (3 * 1)
    - `v = [1; 2; 3]`
    - `v = 1:0.1:2` (matrix range from 1 to 2, with 0.1 step)

- `ones(2, 3)` 2 * 3 matrix with 1s
- `zeros(1, 2)` 1 * 2 matrix with 0s
- `rand(1, 3)` 1 * 3 matrix with random numbers
- `eye(4)` 4 * 4 identity matrix

### Moving Data Around

- `size(A)` gets size of matrix
- `size(A, 1)` size of the first dimension of A (rows)
- `size(A, 2)` size of second dimension of A (columns)

- `length(v)` length of the longest dimension
    - usually applied on vectors

- `pwd` location where octave is running

- `load(featureX.dat)` load data from file in directory
- `who` what variables are loaded in memory
    - `whos` verbose version

- `load hello.mat` load variables from file

- `clear <variable>` removes variable from memory
- `v = priceY(1:10)` `v` is the elements 1-10 of variable `priceY`

- `save filename.mat v` save variable `v` into file called `filename`
- `save hello.txt v -ascii` save as human readable text (ASCII)

- `clear` deletes all the variables in the workspace

```matlab
> A = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6]
> A(3, 2) % ans = 6
> A(2,:) % ":" means every element along that row/column
> A([1, 3], :) % get all elements of A where first index is 1 or 3, from all columns
> A(:, 2) = [10; 11; 12] % assign second column of A to [10; 11; 12] - A becomes [1 10; 3 11; 5 12]
> A = [A, [100; 101; 102]] % append another column vector to right
% A becomess [1 10 11 100; 3 11 101; 5 12 102]
> A(:) % put all elements of A into a single vector
> C = [A B] % concatenates matrix A and B (adds as columns)
> C = [A; B] % adds matrix B to the bottom of matrix A (adds as rows)
```
### Computing on Data

```matlab
> A = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6]
> B = [11 12; 13 14; 15 16]
> C = [1 1; 2 2]
> A * C % matrix multiplication
> A .* B % multiply each element A by corresponding element in B
> A .^ 2 % square each element in A

> v = [1; 2; 3]
> 1 ./ v % 1 over every element in v - v becomes [1; 0.5; 0.3]
> log(v)
> exp(v)
> abs(v) % absolute value of v
> -v % negative v
> v + ones(length(v), 1) % increment v by 1

> A' % transpose of matrix A

> a = [1 15 2 0.5]
> val = max(a) % val = 15
> [val, ind] = max(a) % val = 12, ind = 2 (index)
> a < 3 % ans = 1 0 1 1 because 15 is not < 3
> find(a < 3) % tells you the index for the elements that are 3 in a
> sum(a) % ans = 18.5
> prod(a) % ans = 15
> floor(a) % round down, a = [1 15 2 0]
> ceil(a) % round up, a = [1 15 2 1]

> A = magic(3) % A = [8 1 6; 3 5 7; 4 9 2] N-by-N magic square
> [row, col] = find(A >= 7)
> max(A, [], 1) % max items by first dimension (column) of A [8 9 7]
> max(A, [], 2) % max items by second dimension (row) of A [8; 7; 9]

> A = magic(9)
> sum(A, 1) % sum by column
> sum(A, 2) % sum by row
> A .* eye(9)
> flipud(eye(9)) % flips identity matrix
> pinv(A) % inverse matrix of A
```

### Plotting Data

```matlab
> t = [0:0.01:0.98]
> y1 = sin(2*pi*4*t)
> y2 = cos(2*pi*4*t)
> plot(t, y1)
> hold on
> plot(t, y2, 'r')
> xlabel('time'); ylabel('value')
> legend('sin', 'cos')
> title('my plot')
> print -dpng 'myPlot.png' % saves plot as png
> close % closes the images
> figure(1); plot(t, y1)
> figure(2); plot(t, y2) % plots both graphs on different windows

> subplot(1, 2, 1) % divide plot a 1x2 grid, access first element
> plot(t, y1)
> subplot(1, 2, 2)
> plot(t, y2)
> axis([0.5 1 -1 1])

> clf % clears the figure

> A = magic(5)
> imagesc(A)
> imagesc(A), colorbar, colormap gray % colorized graph

> a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 % comma chaining function calls
```

### Control Statements: for, while, if statement

```matlab
> v = zeros(10, 1)
> for i=1:10, v(i) = 2^i; end;
