### Model Representation

- _Supervised Learning_: Given the "right answer" for each example in the data
    - Regression Problem: Predict real-valued output
        - training set of housing prices
        - `x` = size in feet
        - `y` = price of home
    - Classification: Discrete-valued output
    - Notation:
        - `m` = Number of training examples
        - `x` = "input" variable/features
        - `y` = "output" variable/"target" variable
        - `(x, y)` = one training example
        - (x<sup>(i)</sup>, y<sup>(i)</sup>) = `i`th training example
    - Training Set -> Learning Algorithm -> (size of house `x` -> `h` -> estimated price `y`)
        - where `h` = hypothesis
        - How do we represent `h`? `h(x) = O(0) + O(1)x`
        - Linear regression with one variable (`x`). (univariate linear regression)
    - When the target variable that we're trying to predict is continuous, such as in our housing
    example, we call the learning problem a _regression problem_.
    - When `y` can take on only a small number of discrete values (such as if, given the living
    area, we wanted to predict if a dwelling is a house or an apartment), we call it a
    _classification problem_.

### Cost Function

- Cost function (square error function): J(O<sub>0</sub>, O<sub>1</sub>) = 1/2 sum of (h(x<sup>(i)</sup>) - y<sup>(i)</sup>)<sup>2</sup>
