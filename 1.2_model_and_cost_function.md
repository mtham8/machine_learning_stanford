#### Model Representation

- _Supervised Learning_: Given the "right answer" for each example in the data
    - Regression Problem: Predict real-valued output
        - training set of housing prices
        - `x` = size in feet
        - `y` = price of home
    - Classification: Discrete-valued output
    - Notation:
        - `m` = Number of training examples
        - `x` = "input" variable/features
        - `y` = "output" variable/"target" variable
        - `(x, y)` = one training example
        - `(x^(i), y^(i))` = `i`th training example
    - Training Set -> Learning Algorithm -> (size of house -> `h` -> estimated price)
        - where `h` = hypothesis
        - How do we represent `h`? `h(x) = O(0) + O(1)x`
        - Linear regression with one variable. (univariate linear regression)
